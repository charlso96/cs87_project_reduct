 A. feedback from your classmates about your presentation
---------------------------------------------------------

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well
Interesting topic, very ambitiously framed.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
A more thorough explanation of the problem and its prevalence in the real world

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well

	I thought the subject and knowledge of the subject was very nice.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

	I thought the presentation could use with more interesting slides.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
       - Really cool topic and challenges!

       - It seems that there's a lot of components associated with 
	 this project, and I think it's really amazing how far 
	 you have gotten with this!

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
       - I think the Data Deduplication definition slide could have 
	 been expanded to two slides, especially when you talk about
	 the different kinds of Data Deduplication

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	- nice structure throughout presentation
	- good answers to questions
	- clean and easy to understand slides

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
	- I think you could benefit from explaining deduplication 
	  first before anything, since most of us aren't familiar with
	  this problem, why it is a problem, when it happens, etc.
	- For Keon and Ford, you were reading from the slides instead
	  complementing the slides with more information. We can read 
	  what the slides say but it's not necessarily clear what it means,
	  so it would be good for you guys to go explain in your own words 
	  what the slides mean instead of simply reading from them.
	- For Sam, I felt the interrupting in between 
	  the other members' slides was a little distracting. It would be 
	  better if you three talked and reached an agreement on what 
 	  should and should not be said during a particular slide, so there
	  is no need to add things after someone is done speaking.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  

   Nice justification of project using broad considerations of data usage.
   I also liked the tree diagram of different compression and deduplication
   practices.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

   Talk more about the checks you have in place to make sure that everything
   is done safely. It was explained well considering its complexity,
   but the big figure showing the architecture of the system could be
   explained further.

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
A lot of detail was given to why the choices that were made were made, which
was helpful for understanding thought process.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
The slides were quite dense, with lots of information on each one, making it
hard to digest

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
   
   Good illustrations on the design of the file system, handled questions well

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve 
   
   The material is a bit dense, can go over acronyms and definitions more
   slowly

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
        Good background and motivation provided, useful images and diagrams of
        explanation	

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
        Maybe include a little less on what you're not researching - for a
        topic that few have previous exposure to, explain more of the general
        concepts useful for understanding your implementation and less on the
        other types of implementations that aren't directly relevant to
        understanding your choice (reducing it to a pro/con scenario)

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	> The presentation was split well between each of the members. 
	> The diagram that was used was helpful for understanding the 
        explanation given and visualizing the components of the file system. 


   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
        > It was a bit hard to follow some of the explanations - I wonder if
        they could be simplified a bit. 

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
        This group picks a very ambitious project and I'm impressed that
        they've implemented the core functionalities.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
        I couldn't think of anything, but I'm interested in seeing how they
        could debug and test for a distributed file system.

Data deduplication
  technique for removing redundant/duplicate data
  file level vs block level

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well

   described the differences between file level and block level and laid out
   what parts of their personal file systems they have completed (read, write,
   etc)


   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

   How can you clarify between an intentional duplication and
   a "unnecessary" duplicate i.e what if someone wants an actual copy of a file
   and not a pointer to it for backup purposes

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  

   Excellent explanation of background research, motivation, and concerns, and 
   good use of images to give an overview of the project and explain their 
   methodology. 

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

   The slides were quite dense text-wise, with subpoints being rather small and 
   hard to read as a result, but incorporating images as well gave a good 
   alternative. It would have been great to have the bullet points summarized 
   into main ideas that each speaker could expound in their own words.

---

1. What was at least one thing that the group did well

They did a good job of introducing the topic - what the overall category is,
what the scope of their project is and where it falls in the overall category.

2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

They mentioned what they have next to do in the project, but maybe they could
discuss how they will check when each of these next steps work after
implementation, and how to test the final project when it is done. If there are
other metrics (runtime) that they will evaluate they should discuss that as
well.

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  

   Good diagrams! I really enjoyed the clear exposition of a pretty technical
   and opaque concept.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

   I think more description around the motivation for why deduplication is
   neccesary would have been appreciated.

 B. my feedback on your presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------

* background: 
  * good motivation  (some graphs of growth of data/year might be good here)
  * distinguish between compression and data deduplication, slow down a bit
    
* redundant data techniques
  * nice figure, slow down a bit here
  * take time to briefly explain 3 top level approaches in this tree, 
    and then your path (it is good you did not explain the whole tree,
    but explain the top-level and your path a bit more)

in final presentation: add a slide or two with reminder of DFS, include
clients/server/storage in figure

* deduplication
  * nice slide, refer to your example picture as you talk through
  * slow down a bit here

* However..
  * this slide was hard to follow without knowing a bit more about the details
    of your system
  * in final presentation, present overview of your system first, so that
    audience knows what meta data is and what the hashing is and where it fits
  * more clearly say granularity of deduplication (a block) and what a hash
    is on 

* Our Strategy:  
  * add figure(s) to this in final presentation
  * this should likely be multiple slides in final presentation

* Figure
  * nice, but add a simplified version earlier
  * here, annotate steps on figure, think about using multiple slides that 
    illustrate each step
    * start with main figure
    * at each step new slide that highlights numbers the part you are talking
      about

* Progress & TODO 
   * good progress
   * focus more on the important TODO items vs. listing all
  
   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well

      * logical order to presentation
      * good motivation and presentation of details of implementation  
      * good overall explaination of topic in limited time
      * figure of system is nice (but need more time to talk through all parts)
      * this is an impressive project, and you have clearly made some
        significat progress on implementation of a system you can start
        testing

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

      * add more figures earlier to help audience understand
      * slow down and explain more about your system
      * there were some points where you seemed surprised by the next slide
        make sure you practice your final presentation together a few times 
      * there were points where you need to slow down a bit and explain more
        (you will have more time in your final presentation)
      * split up presentation a bit more evenly among the three of you

 Let's talk about some of your ideas for testing and experimentation 
 later this week or early next week.  There is a lot of ways to go, and
 I think talking through some ideas may be helpful as you start in on 
 this phase.
