CS87 Course project repo

This is my final project, "Reduct, Deduplicated Distributed File System" for
Swarthmore CPSC87 course (Parallel and Distributed Computing), which I
worked on in collaboration with Samuel Rothstein and Ford Johnstone. Please
refer to Powerpoint slides and reports in PPT&Reports for general information
about the project. The source code is under source directory and raw
experimental results are under Results directory.
